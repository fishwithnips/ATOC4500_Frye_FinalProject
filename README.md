# ATOC4500_Frye_FinalProject
This is my final project for the class ATOC4500, taken at the University of Colorado Boulder, in Spring of 2022. This project aims to determine the correlation between ENSO index values and SWE (snowpack) at Berthoud Pass in Loveland, CO. The project completes this objective through a few different data science methods, including linear regression, bootstrapping, and Fisher-Z statistic analysis. The .csv file must be downloaded in order for the notebook to work, but no other changes to the notebook are needed in order to run everything. If any issues seem to arise with this notebook, I can be reached at jafr1867@colorado.edu. If you happen to come across this project after I have exited college, then I can also be reached at my personal email jacob4tkd@yahoo.com. This project will most likely be finalized and last accessed on May 4th, 2022, since that is when the project is due.
